I changed the div class="online-reputation-manager" to article class="online-reputation-manager"
I changed the div class="online-reputation-manager" to article class="online-reputation-manager"
I changed the div class="social-media-marketing" to article class="social-media-marketing"
I changed the div class="benefits" to aside class="benefits"
I changed the div class="benefit-lead" to article class="benefit-lead"

Becasue I added a nav tag to the ul, I need to change the CSS code from div to nav in the appropriate locations in order for the styling to change the itemns in the ul
